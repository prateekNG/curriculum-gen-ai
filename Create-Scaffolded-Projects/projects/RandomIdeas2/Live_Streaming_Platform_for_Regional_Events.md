## Build a Live Streaming Platform for Regional Events

This project will guide you through building a basic React application for showcasing live streams of regional events such as cultural performances, concerts, and festivals. We'll focus on creating a functional user interface with the ability to:

* Display a list of upcoming events with basic details (name, date, time, location, description).
* Play live streams from a video source (we'll use a placeholder for this).
* Allow users to interact with the streams (e.g., like, share, chat).

**Project Phases and Steps:**

**Phase 1: Setting up the Project**

1.  **Create React App:**
    *   Use `npx create-react-app live-events` to create your project.
    *   Navigate into the project directory with `cd live-events`.
2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    *   `npm install @material-ui/core @material-ui/icons react-router-dom`
3.  **Basic Project Structure:**
    *   Create the following folders in `src`:
        *   `components`
        *   `pages`
        *   `styles`
    *   Create the following files:
        *   `App.js` (main application component)
        *   `index.js` (entry point)
        *   `styles/global.css` (global stylesheet)

**Phase 2: Creating the User Interface**

1.  **Header:**
    *   Create `components/Header.js` with basic layout:
        *   Logo (e.g., "Live Events")
        *   Navigation (e.g., Home, Events, About)
        *   Search bar (optional).
    *   Use Material UI components for styling (e.g., `AppBar`, `Toolbar`).
2.  **Homepage:**
    *   Create `pages/Home.js` with:
        *   A hero section with a welcome message and image.
        *   A section for featured events with a carousel (optional).
3.  **Event Listing:**
    *   Create `components/EventCard.js` for displaying individual event details:
        *   Event name
        *   Date and time
        *   Location (address or map)
        *   Image (thumbnail or banner)
        *   Brief description
    *   Create `pages/Events.js` with:
        *   A list of events (use `EventCard` components).
        *   Consider using a grid layout to display multiple events per row.

**Phase 3: Implementing Live Streaming**

1.  **Video Player:**
    *   Create `components/LivePlayer.js` for the video player:
        *   Use `video` tag (for a placeholder video source).
        *   Add controls (play/pause, volume, fullscreen).
        *   Add a loading indicator.
2.  **Placeholder Video Source:**
    *   Find a free video source (e.g., YouTube, Vimeo).
    *   Embed the video using its URL in the `LivePlayer` component.
    *   **Note:** Replacing this with an actual live stream will require more advanced setup and integration with a streaming service.

**Phase 4: Adding User Interaction**

1.  **Like/Share:**
    *   Add buttons for like/share within the `LivePlayer` component.
    *   Consider using Material UI icons for these actions.
    *   **Note:** Implement actual like/share functionality using a backend system or social media API if needed.
2.  **Chat:**
    *   Add a simple chat feature within the `LivePlayer` component:
        *   Use a basic `input` for message input.
        *   Display messages in a `ul` or similar container.
        *   **Note:** For real-time chat, you'll need to implement server-side logic (e.g., using WebSockets).

**Phase 5: Styling and Refinement**

1.  **Styles:**
    *   Create `styles/eventListing.css` and `styles/livePlayer.css` to style specific components.
    *   Use Material UI for additional styling and customization (e.g., typography, colors, spacing).
2.  **Responsive Design:**
    *   Make your application responsive across different screen sizes.
    *   Use CSS media queries or a responsive layout library.
3.  **Additional Features:**
    *   Implement user authentication (e.g., with Firebase) to allow users to save events, create profiles, etc.
    *   Add search functionality to filter events.
    *   Integrate a calendar to display event schedules.

**Phase 6: Testing and Deployment**

1.  **Testing:**
    *   Write unit tests to ensure your components function correctly.
    *   Use Jest and React Testing Library.
2.  **Deployment:**
    *   Deploy your application to a hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).
    *   Make sure to set up a suitable hosting environment for your chosen live streaming service if needed.

**Hint: `EventCard.js`**

```javascript
import React from "react";
import "./eventListing.css";

const EventCard = ({ event }) => {
  return (
    <div className="event-card">
      <img src={event.image} alt={event.name} />
      <h2>{event.name}</h2>
      <p>
        <span>{event.date}</span> | <span>{event.time}</span>
      </p>
      <p>{event.location}</p>
      <p>{event.description}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default EventCard;
```

**Hint: `LivePlayer.js`**

```javascript
import React, { useState } from "react";
import "./livePlayer.css";

const LivePlayer = () => {
  const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false);

  const handlePlayPause = () => {
    setIsPlaying(!isPlaying);
  };

  return (
    <div className="live-player">
      <video
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/your-video-id"
        controls
        autoPlay={isPlaying}
      ></video>
      <button onClick={handlePlayPause}>
        {isPlaying ? "Pause" : "Play"}
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default LivePlayer;
```
