### Phase 2: Authentication and User Management

**1. Authentication Setup:**
   - Choose an authentication service (Firebase, Auth0, etc.)
   - Install the necessary package: `npm install firebase` (for Firebase)
   - Set up authentication configuration in your project.

**2. AuthContext:**
   - Create `AuthContext.js` to manage user authentication state and provide access to authentication functions:
     ```javascript
     import React, { createContext, useContext, useState, useEffect } from "react";
     import { auth } from "./services/auth";

     const AuthContext = createContext();

     const AuthProvider = ({ children }) => {
       const [currentUser, setCurrentUser] = useState(null);
       const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);

       useEffect(() => {
         const unsubscribe = auth.onAuthStateChanged((user) => {
           setCurrentUser(user);
           setIsLoading(false);
         });
         return unsubscribe;
       }, []);

       return (
         <AuthContext.Provider value={{ currentUser, isLoading }}>
           {children}
         </AuthContext.Provider>
       );
     };

     const useAuth = () => useContext(AuthContext);

     export { AuthProvider, useAuth };
     ```

**3. Login and Signup:**
   - Implement the `Login.js` and `SignUp.js` components for user login and account creation.

### Phase 3: Core Components

**1. NavBar:**
   - Design a `NavBar.js` component that provides navigation for the application.
   - Include links for Home, Login, Signup, and possibly a user profile section.
   - Implement conditional rendering based on the authentication state.
   - Consider adding a search bar for finding local businesses.

**2. BusinessCard:**
   - Create a `BusinessCard.js` component to display basic information about a local business:
     - Name
     - Location
     - Short Description
     - Link to business profile

**3. BusinessProfile:**
   - Develop a `BusinessProfile.js` component to showcase detailed business information:
     - Name
     - Description
     - Location
     - Business Hours
     - Contact Information
     - Reviews/Ratings
     - Gallery (photos/videos)
     - Posts (latest updates, promotions)

**4. Post:**
   - Build a `Post.js` component to display individual posts on the platform.
   - Include content, date/time, author, and a comment section.
   - Consider adding features for liking, sharing, and reporting posts.

**5. Comment:**
   - Create a `Comment.js` component for individual comments within a post.
   - Include comment text, author, date/time, and a reply section.

   - Display user information (name, profile picture, bio)
   - Allow users to update their profile settings
   - Show a list of the user's posts and saved businesses.

**7. Footer:**
   - Create a simple `Footer.js` component with copyright information and links to terms of service, privacy policy, etc.

### Phase 4: Data Handling and API Integration

**1. Database Design:**
   - Design the database schema to store user information, business data, posts, and comments.
   - Use Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore for database storage.

**2. API Calls:**
   - Create functions in `services/database.js` to:
     - Fetch business data
     - Create new posts
     - Fetch posts for a specific business
     - Add/delete comments
     - Update user information
     - Implement authentication methods in `services/auth.js`.

### Phase 5: Building the Pages

   - Implement a feed of recent posts from businesses the user follows or businesses in their local area.
   - Include a section for suggested businesses or local events.

**2. Business Page:**
   - Create the `Business.js` component to display a specific business profile page.
   - Load and display the business information using the API calls defined in `services/database.js`.
   - Render the business's posts and comments.
   - Allow users to follow or interact with the business.

### Phase 6: Styling and Design

**1. Styling:**
   - Use CSS to style the components, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
   - Create separate CSS files for each component for better organization.
   - Consider using a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Material-UI to assist with layout and styling.

**2. Visual Design:**
   - Choose a theme and color palette that aligns with the purpose of the application.
   - Implement a responsive design to ensure the app works well on different screen sizes.
   - Use images and icons to enhance the visual appeal.

### Phase 7: Testing and Deployment

**1. Unit Testing:**
   - Write unit tests for components and functions to ensure code quality and functionality.

**2. Integration Testing:**
   - Test the interactions between different components and API calls.

**3. Deployment:**
   - Deploy the application to a hosting service like Firebase Hosting or Netlify.
   - Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.

### Additional Features (Optional)
